# Dirty Napkin Hub
- All repos must be public for branch protection to work correctly
- All changes should be made on branches, not `main`. Once you are done making your changes, please submit a pull request
- Website repos are structured off of Josh's folder structure, but slightly reconfigured so that they actually work
- Be sure to fetch and pull from the desktop app (or vscode integration) and create a branch before making changes
- `placeholder.txt` files are just because github wouldn't commit empty folders, feel free to delete them when adding something
- If there’s stuff that you notice that you’re not up for, you can create an issue
- File names use underscores. Anything in the code is camel case (variables, functions, ids, classes, etc)
